# Hacking: Explained

At first, you stare at an unknown system. You understand nothing but try everything.

After a while, you slowly begin to understand how parts of the system work.

You dig deeper and deeper. Hours go by. All of your attempts to uncover a flaw in the system fail.

You start to lose your patience. Your mind relentlessly tries to uncover the flaw in your attempt to uncover the flaw.

You continue to try things because you know you have to try harder.

Each step taken from here is a mirror of your knowledge, understanding, cleverness and intuition at this very moment. A wild ride through your neural pathways.

On the hunt for something out of the ordinary you send out your little neuronal spiders to crawl every bit of information about the system and match it against your ever-extending knowledge base. No stone is left unturned. No assumptions about the system's limits are made. You don't ask the system what it can do for you, you will find a way to make it do what you want.

All of a sudden, something unexpected happens. Your gut already knows what's going on, but your mind tells you that this can't be true. "It's probably just a glitch", you tell yourself.

You try to repeat what you've done. There it is again, the random glitch that's no longer a random glitch. It has become reproducible. You've become its god.

You attempt to trace its roots. You follow it through the system. Deep down the rabbit hole you find what you've been looking for.

There it is. Right in front of you. The flaw that tried so hard to hide itself from the world.

As its god you understand how it works. You understand how to leverage it to defeat the system.

You string together the instructions that will ultimately lead to its demise. It started as a seemingly random glitch, then became reproducible and through your understanding at this very moment in time manifested itself as a fully automated exploit.

Congratulations, friend. You are now the god of the system.
