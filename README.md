# Down the Rabbit Hole

![](alice.jpeg)

At first, you stare at an unknown system. You understand nothing but try everything.

After a while, you slowly begin to understand how parts of the system work.

You dig deeper and deeper. Hours go by. All of your attempts to uncover a flaw in the system fail.

You start to lose your patience. Your mind relentlessly tries to uncover the flaw in your attempt to uncover the flaw.

You continue to try things because you know you have to try harder.

Each step taken from here is a reflection of your knowledge, creativity and intuition at this very moment. A wild ride through your neural pathways.

On the hunt for something out of the ordinary you soak up every bit of information about the system and match it against your ever-extending knowledge base. No stone is left unturned. No assumptions about the system's limits are made. You don't ask the system what it can do for you, you will find a way to make it do what you want.

All of a sudden, something unexpected happens. Your gut already knows what's going on, but your mind tells you that this can't be true. "It's probably just a glitch", you tell yourself.

You try to repeat what you've done. There it is again, the random glitch that's no longer a random glitch. It has become reproducible. You've become its god.

You attempt to trace its roots. You follow it through this digital maze that is the system. Deep down the rabbit hole you find what you've been looking for.

There it is. Right in front of you. The flaw that tried so hard to hide itself from the world.

As its god you understand how it works. You understand how to leverage it to defeat the system.

You string together the instructions that will ultimately lead to its demise. It started as a seemingly random glitch. An elusive glitch that lost its elusiveness through the power of the tracers and probes mapping out this digital maze at your command. In this final phase of your tedious battle against the system you leverage all of your knowledge and creativity at this very moment in time and force the glitch to manifest itself as a fully automated exploit.

Now that you control it, you ask the glitch what its name is. It tells you what it waited to tell for all its life:

``` cmd
C:\Windows\system32> whoami
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Congratulations, friend. You are now the god of the system.
